# How did the Deep Learning model achieve 100% accuracy?
This is my first article in Medium and it is also published in towardsdatascience.com. Please refer to this article to understand the importance of exploratory data analysis while implementing a neural network for image classification. The article will take you through the process of implementing transfer learning approach to multi-class image classification problem. I have included details and analysis of fine-tuning based transfer learning approach using the ResNet50 model. The implementation has been documented appropriately in the Google Colab notebook.
